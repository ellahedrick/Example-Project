We worked on this project at the same time in-person in the library (with appropriate COVID-mitigation measures, of course). Thus, all the git pushes are from the hansf123 GitHub account as we were each creating one function at a time, and sending them to one computer to test as we went. We both did equal work, whether it was working seperately on two functions at once, working together to brainstorm the best approach to a problem, or checking each other's code. Our contribution breakdown for the main tasks is below:

Ella:
- UML Diagram
- hasWinner() / checkIsWinner() to determine the end of the game
- default doMove() logic for the players

Hans:
- Scaladoc Documentation
- New showGameArea() implementation to better display each player's cards
- Arrangement logic to display each of the players' three lists of cards

Together:
- Test Cases
- doTurn() / doGame() to run through the game
- General game logic brainstorming
